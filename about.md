title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is Thang Nguyen and I'm currently an undergraduate at Purdue University majoring in Cybersecurity with a minor in English. I grew to love computers when I was about 10-11.
I wanted a new computer to be able to play Overwatch, so my uncle helped me to build one, but I honestly didn't contribute much and just watched him. However, I did get some hands on experience
once I found out that he had built me a computer with no graphics card. I didn't want to trouble him any further so I decided to take on this endeavor on my own.
Starting off, I didn't even know what a graphics card was, which led me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out which parts of my computer was holding me back from playing.
Learning about computers and actually being able to tinker with it helped me to develop my passion for computers from a young age. I still hold this same love for computers as I have made
five different computer builds with my friend and created seven custom mechanical keyboards. Messing with computer parts and wires has been a passion of mine for years now and I'm so glad that I'm able to 
continue that passion in my college career and hopefully into the real world.

My minor in English was completely unplanned for and came as a surprise even to myself. As a child I've also always loved reading and writing. If you put down a good fantasy novel in front of a younger
version of myself, consider it completely read in the next two days. However, Once high school came and I was assigned reading tasks that didn't interest me, I started to dislike reading and only
associated it with doing homework. This was the same case for my start at Purdue, I only thought of reading as mundane and required for completing assignments. However, during a meeting with my advisor I
found out that to graduate, I needed to take nine credit hours in a subject that wasn't related to my major or anywhere near my major at all. Originally, I had planned to just fill that requirement
with leadership classes and be over with that requirement. Later that night when I was talking with my brother, he mentioned that he had majored in English and how he loved being surrounded by
others that share his same passion for reading and writing. That definitely intrigued me, so I decided to try taking a creative writing class as part of this requirement just to test the waters.
I took that creative writing class last semester and it was one of the most hard but enjoyable classes that I have taken during my college career. I was overflowing with ideas on differnet stories to write
and thinking of new additions that I could add to my stories. Although it had been a while since I wrote anything, I still persevered and wrote whatever stories came to mind just to get my ideas somewhere.
I also thoroughly enjoyed being surrounded by others that were also interested in creative writing. Being able to bounce ideas and share criticisms with one another became the highlight of my mornings and
something that I was always excited to do. After taking the class, I didn't want to just fulfill the requirement for graduation, I wanted to pursue even more english and decided to round up the requirement
to a minor.

To whoever read this tangent, thank you and I hope that you're also able to find subjects that interest you to no end.
