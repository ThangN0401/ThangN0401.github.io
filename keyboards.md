# Keyboard Collection

Here are some of my custom keyboard builds:

In this photo you can see that I've labeled the different layers of the inside of a keyboard. The first layer, the switches, are the main factor of your typing experience. They dictate the majority of the sound and feel. These swithces can be clacky, deep sounding, silent, etc. There are two different types of switches, tactile and linear. Tactile swithces give you physical feedback everytime you press a key. This allows the user to know that a key has successfully been pressed. These switches tend to be on the louder side as this feedback can sometimes be heard. Linear switches on the other hand provide a smoother experience as they don't provide any feedback whatsoever. Typically, people recommend using tactile switches for work so that you can feel when a typo is made. Linear swithces are usually recommended for gaming as some people don't want to constantly feel feedback for every action.

The next layer is the gasket mount. There are many different ways to mount switches and this also affects the sound of your keyboard. I've personally only used gasket mounts before and havn't tried any other mounting method

The next layer is the foam layer. I've added foam into the layers of this keyboard to provide a more full and deeper sound. Without the foam, it felt a bit to hollow and metallic.

The most important layer is the pcb plate. This is the brain of the keyboard and ensures that your key presses are properly being sent to the computer. It's recommended to test this layer before building the keyboard to ensure that you aren't going to build a keyboard with a faulty pcb board and have to take it apart to replace it.

The final layer is additional foam at the bottom of the keyboard

For this keyboard, I used gazzew boba u4t tactile switches with no lubing.

This is a photo of my favorite keyboard build. It utilizes the Matrix Navi case with the GMK Tuzi keycaps. The swithces are gateron oil kings as they are my favorite linear switches. Lubing the swithces gives such a smooth and deep sound that no other switch has provided. These also utilize the Staebies V2 stabilizers. These are pretty pricey for stabilizers, but their performance is unmatched. Many people have issues with the tight housing and to be honest, I also disliked it at first. However, after a month of use they have grown to be my favorite stabilizers. The tight housing eliminates any rattle and creates such a rich and deep spacebar sound. The tight housing requires more force to be used on the space bar, which is hard to get used to, but after a while, I've grown to like it.

This is a collection of most of my keyboards, however, I don't currently have all of them with me as I left one or two boards at my parent's house.
